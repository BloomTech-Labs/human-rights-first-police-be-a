The officer is pushing the man back across the street and the man is attempting to walk the opposite direction. After the officer pushes the protester to the sidewalk, the officer turns to walk away. The protester then lightly strikes the body-armored officer on the back with his cane; the cane then collapses, suggesting it is a collapsible cane, not capable of striking forcefully. The officer then pepper sprays the protester and tackles him to the ground for arrest.\n\nWhile it is clear the protester did strike the officer, the question of brutality lies in the force used by the officer: the use of pepper spray and the tackling a man using a cane appear to be disproportionate to the protester's light strike.",

    desc: 'Philadelphia police approach a car in the street on the 5200 block of Chestnut Street, beating it with their batons. Officers then smash out the driver side window before opening the door, beating the driver and front passenger with batons. Police also pulled a child out of the backseat of the car. Later reporting has stated that the driver and her 16 year old out of the car. They were hospitalized and handcuffed to their hospital beds while being treated. The following morning they were released without charges, though the mother\'s hospital bracelet read: "assault on police." The driver was able to contact her mother, the grandmother of the child pulled from the backseat. The grandmother went to the scene of the incident, then was directed four miles away, where she found the boy in a squad car. She said the boy had a lump on his head and his carseat still contained glass from the broken windows. An attorney representing the family has stated they have been told neither the current location of the family\'s SUV nor any process to retrieve the vehicle. The lawyer also states that the family is showing signs of trauma, including the young boy, who is hearing impaired and still learning to speak.\n\nSeveral days later, the Fraternal Order of Police posted on several social media outlets that they had rescued a child wandering barefoot on the streets during the protest, following by several police slogans, like "We are the thin blue line," and reiterating a common pro-police point about standing between order and anarchy. The child in the post was in fact the child pulled by police from the car. The posts have since been deleted. The day after the posts (10/30), the Fraternal Order of Police released a statement saying there were "conflicted accounts under which the child came to be assisted by the officer."',

The independent reporter was held longer than The Daily Caller reporter, but appears to have been released early on October 9th. One Daily Caller reporter also reports being struck with a baton.\n\nAdditional footage shows a Daily Caller filming arrests of protesters made by National Guard. The officers tell the Daily Caller reporter to leave the are. He states he is press but returns to his car in the parking lot nonetheless. Officers follow him to his car, causing the incident.\n\nThe independent journalist has since tweeted that he sustained a concussion.",

    title: 'Police surround protesters and search their bags',
    desc: "At a protest on August 15th, police kettled protesters at West Marble Place and South LaSalle Street. Police refused to allow protesters to leave without a bag search. Officers took protesters' bags and dumped them onto the sidewalk.\n\nThe 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives individuals the right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches. Most warrantless searches are considered unreasonable, with the exception of searches with consent of the searched or with probable cause. By disallowing protesters to leave, police did not allow protesters to consent. Further, probable cause has been determined on several occassions to be individualized, meaning that individuals on the premises of a crime scene cannot be searched simply for being present; rather, probable cause must be established for each individual, as in [Ybarra v. Illinois](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/78-5937) and [United States v. Di Re](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/332/581/). This means that, in order to search protester's belongings, police would have needed to establish probable cause for each protester searched.\n\nThe Terry standard does allow police to briefly detain and search an individual on reasonable suspicion, which has a lower bar than probable cause. In [Terry v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/), the U.S. Supreme Court stated that police may stop and frisk - which is limited to an external pat down (e.g. for an readily-usable weapon), but does not include bag searches - an individual on the basis of reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion is defined in the case as the reasonable suspicion that an individual may have committed, be committing, or is about to commit a crime. There must additionally be the reasonable belief that the individual is armed and dangerous. In addition, this reasonable suspicion is individualized, so police must have established reasonable suspicion that each protester searched was both armed and engaged in, had engaged in, or was going to engage in criminal conduct.\n\nAfter reviewing the rights of protesters, it appears that police conducted these searches illegally, abusing their power to prevent protesters from leaving.",

Police beat multiple protesters with batons and pepper sprayed others. A Cottonwood Heights city councilwoman stated she was struck by police.

The protester is now home and is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nThe other protester was shot repeatedly in the abdomen. One round pierced through his skin, fat and a first layer of muscle on his back. A trauma surgeon investigated and found that the round had not pierced the protester's abdominal cavity.",

      'Police make violent arrests, including ripping a protester out of his wheelchair and inducing an asthma attack',
    desc: "Footage shows a scuffle as police arrest protesters. A protester in a wheelchair pushes police away from him. Police then knock him backwards out of his chair. The man attempts to pull himself away. Police close in. The protester grabs the officer's baton, but multiple officers restrain him and take his wheelchair away. One officer drags the chair and appears to knock a wheel loose, which then falls off after the officer scuffles with another protester. The protester who was in the wheelchair passively resists by locking his arms while police arrest him. Body cam footage released by the LAPD shows the man in the wheelchair striking an officer in the face during a physical altercation between the protester and the officer. Notably, the LAPD footage fails to show the lead up to the protester in the wheelchair slapping the officer.\n\nFootage from instagram (second link, fourth in list) shows a man suffering an asthma attack after allegedly being struck in the neck with a baton. The last video in the instagram post appears to show the man on a gurney receiving medical attention. Other videos in the post show police shoving protesters with their hands and with batons. The poster also alleges that police held a woman in a chokehold.\n\nAdditional [footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCqPuekHCyg/) shows an officer striking a protester with a baton as the protester tries to help the man in the wheelchair.\n\nAnother [update](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCxPb28hRdN/) states all charges against him were dropped.",

    desc: 'Footage from two livestreamers on July 1st shows their arrests. LMPD arrested livestreamers the previous night as well. It should be noted that these independent journalists are not always credentialed, but they are known for releasing full, unedited footage of the protests.\n\nThe ACLU has raised concerns that these arrests are inhibiting freedom of the press, while Louisville Metropolitan Police Department has stated that the department "has no issue with anyone livestreaming. But many of those livestreaming are also protesting. And anyone protesting who fails to follow police orders to disperse may be arrested."\n\nThe journalist from MilkyMess TV took 1st person footage of their arrest. Around 1:50:00 in her Facebook live post, she is wandering around a crowd of protesters on the sidewalk. The journalist does not appear to be chanting or singing with protesters. Several police cruisers pull up and officers step out. The journalist steps forward to get a better look and is arrested without a word. The camera is knocked from her hand.\n\nAn additional livestream from a reporter affiliated with WDRB News shows the incident. Beginning at 3:05:00, police arrive, appear to single out MilkyMess and tackle her to the ground. The reporter asks why she is being arrested. A police officer says, "Trespassing." It should be noted that MilkyMess was on a public sidewalk and numerous other individuals were not arrested. Around 3:11:00, the WDRB reporter walks over to another arrestee. Shortly after, the reporter asks an officer if he should be in the street or sidewalk. The officer tells him he\'s "gotta go." The reporter crosses to the other side of the street and asks another person if there were arrests. The individual says there was one arrest. This totals 3 arrests for trespassing on a park/public sidewalk out of a group of 30-40 individuals.',

A group of around 3 young people decided to hold an impromptu counter-protest, and parked across the street from the CVP protesters. CVP protesters came across the street and began shouting at the counter-protesters. Some time later, video shows one counter-protester on the ground, on the CVP proesters' side of the street, being beaten by CVP protesters. Another counter-protester is trying to intervene but being physically restrained by CVP protesters; a third is filming the incident as CVP protesters heckle her. Photos taken after the incident show at least two of the protesters badly beaten. Each side says the other started the altercation.\n\nPolice arrived shortly thereafter. They told the counter-protesters to wait in police cars (allegedly for their own protection); the counter-protesters say they were kept in police cars for nearly an hour. The CVP protesters were not put into police cars. One counter-protester says that counter-protesters tried to leave multiple times, but were told that they were not free to go. Police can be seen shaking the hand of one of the CVP protesters; counter-protesters claim police were somewhat dismissive of their allegations of assault against the CVP protesters. No arrests were made, but a report concerning the incident has been referred to the DA.",

One protester remained seated and police manhandled her.\n\nSeveral protesters, including the filmer, shouted at the police for treating the protester roughly. The officer then told these protesters to back up. They obeyed. The officer then pepper sprayed them repeatedly as they walked away. Police continued to harass protesters, pushing them from the sidewalk to the lawn. It is unclear why police asserted the sidewalk was an unacceptable place to stand.\n\nFrom an article in the Arizona Mirror, Tempe police are allowed to use pepper spray "against violent or non-compliant subjects, and on vicious animals." In addition, they must give verbal warning that they will escalate. No such warning was given.',

It is unclear if this is from the first round of pepper spray or she has been sprayed a second time. Medics attempt to assist her but are forced to continue marching while doing so. Around 7 minutes, medics help her into a car. She is treated for the duration of the footage.\n\nAdditional links from a reporter discuss the tactics used by police to intimidate and harass protesters. They also capture the aftermath of the pepper-spraying.',

Andrés' father addressed the crowd in English and in Spanish. Deputies in riot gear pointed guns at protesters who chanted \"put down your guns.\" A Sheriff Department helicopter flew overhead urging local residents who had joined the march to leave and go home so that they would not be tear-gassed when outside agitators were dealt with. Black protesters and protest leaders shared hugs with Guardado's family to show solidarity between the Black and Latino communities. As a few mothers of children slain by LAPD or LASD told their stories, a group of protesters split off to confront a second band of Deputies in riot gear. One protester yelled \"F*** the police!\" The deputies opened fire with non-lethal rounds, tear gas, and flash bangs.\n\nFootage shows scattered protesters on pedestrian walkway with deputies firing tear gas around them. Additional footage shows protesters helping one another recover from the damage.\n\nA journalist states they were tear-gassed while holding up their press badge in plain view.\n\nFootage shows police and protesters separated by a barricade. Protesters shout at deputies to put their guns down. Without verbal warning, deputies fire on protesters.\n\nIn footage from a journalist, a protester wearing a U.S. military jacket shows off wounds to the head and abdomen from less-lethal rounds shot by deputies.",

He appears to begin bleeding from his ear and passes out.\n\nBuffalo P.D. released an official statement saying that he "tripped and fell." After video of the incident surfaced, however, both officers were suspended, an internal affairs investigation was opened, and both officers were charged with assault. In response to the suspension, the Buffalo Emergency Response Team [resigned from their posts](https://nypost.com/2020/06/05/buffalo-emergency-response-team-quits-in-solidarity-of-cops/).

Officers had trouble getting the zip ties off; they had to use a pocket knife in addition to the usual tool. Harriot was also interviewed by two agents claiming to be from the FBI.',

    desc: "Police arrested protesters en masse near the home of LA mayor Eric Garcetti and in other parts of the city, zip tied their hands, and held them for extended periods without appropriate social distancing. At least one arrestee alleges that protesters were given explicit permission to remain past the curfew, then arrested for being out after curfew. Many arrestees say they were released in the middle of the night, without transportation home, in unfamiliar parts of the city.\n\nSeveral arrestees describe police sexually harassing/assaulting them; other arrestees corroborate these accounts. Two arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because they requested medical attention and other improvements in their conditions, which would constitute first-amendment-protected speech. Four other arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because some arrestees removed unsafely-tight zip ties using a lighter. All arrestees who have shared accounts mention officers behaving in a mocking, condescending, and unprofessional manner. One arrestee recalls asking officers to turn on bodycams, and officers refusing to do so. If true, this would be a clear violation of LAPD policy. One arrestee allegedly should have been exempt from the curfew as they were returning home from work.\n\nA lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers' Guild. (See also incidents ca-losangeles-19 (near-identical behavior the previous day) and ca-santamonica-2 (similar behavior in Santa Monica).)",

    desc: 'Protesters had congregated near the intersection of North 6th Street and McKinley Avenue. Over the course of about an hour, police moved forward, dispersing the protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets, first pushing the protesters a block and a half then pushing them off of North 6th Street entirely. Video shows police shooting rubber bullets at protesters on a sidewalk and firing gas canisters, in large number, at a small group of peaceful protesters. (At least some tear gas was used, but it is unclear how much. Police say they also used smoke canisters.)\n\nPolice claim they used force to disperse the crowd after rocks and glass were thrown at them. Police also said at the time that "Molotov cocktails" were thrown at them. They later walked that statement back to say that one Molotov Cocktail was thrown. They say it did not ignite. Media and protesters present say they saw water bottles being thrown, but not glass, rocks, or a Molotov cocktail. Video released by police clearly shows something being thrown at police, but doesn\'t show what it was. Police also produced a picture of a crushed water bottle and what looks like a water pump and implied it was the remnants of a Molotov cocktail.\n\nNOTE: this incident immediately follows wi-milwaukee-1. Because the misconduct involved is substantially different, it has been given its own incident.',

Around 9 PM, law enforcement gassed a crowd chanting “we want peace.” Local news says some people were throwing water bottles and firecrackers. Police also claim rocks were thrown. Police claim that at least one police vehicle was damaged. Local news reports vary -- some reports have protesters "kicking" a police vehicle; some televised reports have protesters "damaging" a police vehicle; most written articles merely report that police say protesters damaged a police vehicle.\n\nIt is unclear whether any order to disperse was given before the first use of tear gas; in the videos purporting to be from that time, no such order is audible. (In one video -- see third link -- a voice can be heard that sounds like it comes from a PA system, but the words are unclear.) Several people present, including one op-ed writer, claim not to have heard any such order. Orders to disperse were certainly given repeatedly between 9:00 and 11:00, as police continued to deploy tear gas.\n\nPolice posted on the City of Bentonville Facebook page that rubber bullets were not used. Police did, in fact, use rubber bullets (per 5 News); per the op ed, the police chief attributed the error to a "communication failure."',

      'Police arrest protesters en masse and detain them in poor conditions',
    desc: 'Police arrested protesters en masse in downtown Los Angeles. Protesters hands were zip tied excessively tightly behind their backs and they were loaded onto buses and driven around the city. Some were taken to a temporary field jail at UCLA\'s Jackie Robinson stadium; UCLA claims it "failed to stop" LAPD from using the stadium as a "staging area," but was not told about the field jail until after the fact. Arestees were detained for long periods, still in excessively tight zip ties. Social distancing procedures were not observed.\n\nMany protesters allege that conditions in the makeshift jails were poor -- detainees denied medical attention and permission to use the restroom, for instance -- and that they were released, many with dead phones, in unfamiliar places in the middle of the night with no way to get home. Two arrestees allege that police prevented them from leaving before the curfew went into effect, then arrested them for violating the curfew. One arrestee alleges that she was twice threatened with guns, that she was sexually assaulted by police, and that police mocked detainees having panic attacks. Police also allegedly arrested at least one homeless person (to whom the curfew was not supposed to apply) for a curfew violation.\n\nA lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers\' Guild; a separate lawsuit has been filed by one of the arrestees. (See also incidents ca-losangeles-32 (near-identical behavior the following day) and ca-santamonica-2 (similar behavior in Santa Monica).)',

    desc: "Police in northern California fatally shot an unarmed 22-year-old who was on his knees with his hands up outside a Walgreens store while responding to a call of alleged looting, officials said... An officer in the city of Vallejo was inside his car when he shot Sean Monterrosa on Monday night amid local and national protests against police brutality. Police said an officer mistakenly believed Monterrosa had a gun, but later determined he had a hammer in his pocket... 'When confronted by the police, he dropped to his knees and surrendered, and they fired at him,' said Melissa Nold, a Vallejo civil rights attorney representing Monterrosa’s family.\n\nSix officers fired 55 bullets in 3.5 seconds; police investigation determined this use of force 'reasonable.'\n\nVallejo PD has posted composite video containing body cam footage, radio chatter with Dispatch and prior footage of Walgreen's security cameras being destroyed. This footage shows a car with alleged looters peeling out of the Walgreens as police arrive; this car strikes an unmarked police vehicle and continues. Police open the doors of their unmarked van and fire on Monterrosa immediately and without warning. They state that they believed Monterrosa was armed, thought it turned out to be only a hammer.",

      'Tattoo artist arrested while painting the outside of his shop; police fail to deescalate',
    desc: "Jamison Walker, a Cincinnati tattoo artist at Black Fern Tattoo, was painting the outside of the shop after curfew (with the owner's permission). He alleges that a police officer told him he could finish his work. The Instagram video begins at some later point as several cops approach. They tell Walker (and at least two other persons present) to \"get inside.\" For around 12 seconds, two police officers, Walker, and one other tattoo shop employee are talking simultaneously; Walker told local news he tried to go inside but one officer blocked his path. One officer can be heard to say \"I'm giving you a chance, go in,\" then another can be heard to say \"That's exactly what's going to happen -- no -- no no -- inside, go inside, inside -- go inside, there's no debate -- no, you may not.\" Said officer then begins arresting Walker. Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to \"get the fuck back -- get back.\" It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back. In total, at least eight police officers are present, of whom at least two draw their tasers, despite facing little to no resistance.\n\nNOTE: While curfews in many cities exempted anyone going to or from work, Cincinnati's exempted only essential workers. Tattoo artists are not essential, so Walker's arrest was likely lawful, though officers unnecessarily escalated the situation as they were arresting him.",

These protesters were zip tied and held for long periods, in tight quarters which did not permit social distancing, then released late at night with no way to get home. At least one detainee alleges that detainees were denied medical care and permission to use the restroom.\n\nZip ties were put on too tight. Police attempted to remove zip ties with a long knife (which is not the appropriate tool). This led to multiple protesters being injured, including one who required 21 stitches; it seems unlikely that the knife was appropriately sterilized between uses, raising the possibility of bloodborne pathogen transmission.\n\nOne protester, who has lived in Santa Monica since high school, states police dropped him and other protesters off outside town late at night. Police then told him he would be arrested if he returned to Santa Monica.\n\n(See also incidents ca-losangeles-19 and ca-losangeles-32 (similar behavior in Los Angeles). Note that the final link incorrectly states that the incident it describes was perpetrated by LAPD; in fact, as several commenters pointed out, it was perpetrated by Santa Monica PD, though there are allegations of similar conduct by the LAPD.)',
